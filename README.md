# CircularPong
This is a little game I made in p5js as a prototype. You play pong by yourself in a circle.

Here's what it looks like:

There is also a rainbow mode:

As you score more and more the circle gets larger and larger, making it harder to continue.
This is just a prototype but it taught me a lot about p5 and just js in general, so good times!
I also had to write some very interesting code for rotating verticies to accept collision with rotated shapes. I couldnt find a library for it unfortunately.
